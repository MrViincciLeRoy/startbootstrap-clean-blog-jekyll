Strelitzia reginae is native to the Cape Provinces and KwaZulu-Natal. It is widely cultivated for its dramatic flowers. In temperate areas it is a popular houseplant. A new subspecies was discovered growing alongside the Mzimvubu River in South Africa’s Eastern Cape in 2002. When wild-collected plants began to flower in the greenhouse at Kirstenbosch, they were noted to have white, rather than the typical blue inner petals. Strelitzia reginae subsp. mzimvubuensis had a shorter stigma (10-15mm vs. 30mm) and subtle differences of the leaves. It is possibly a mutation that is in the process of speciating. The plant grows to 2 m (6+1⁄2 ft) tall, with large, strong leaves 25–70 cm (10–28 in) long and 10–30 cm (4–12 in) broad. The hard, beak-like sheath from which the flower emerges is termed the spathe. Strelitzia reginae has three purplish-blue or white petals. Two of the petals are joined together to form an arrow-like nectary. When the sunbirds sit to drink the nectar, the third petal opens to release the anther and cover their feet in pollen. It was first introduced to Britain in 1773, when it was grown at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. In the United States, Florida and California are the main areas of cultivation, due to their warm climate. S. reginae has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It is a low-maintenance plant that is easy to grow in the garden. If cared for well, they will flower several times in a year. They do well in full sun to semi-shade and respond well to regular feeding with a controlled release fertiliser and compost. They are sensitive to cold and need to be sheltered from frost, as it can damage the flowers and leaves. Bird-of-paradise plants have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 1, and are considered "allergy-fighting"; they produce no airborne pollen. There is a yellow-flowered cultivar of this plant known as ‘Mandela's Gold’. g. The plant can be found in the UK and the U.S. as well as in Australia and New Zealand. It can also be grown in South Africa and the United States. It is grown in the wild as a ornamental plant.
