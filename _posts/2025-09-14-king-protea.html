The king protea is the national flower of South Africa. Protea cynaroides is adapted to survive wildfires by its thick underground stem, which contains many dormant buds. The flower has a long vase life in flower arrangements, and makes for an excellent dried flower. The species is also known as giant protea, honeypot, or king sugar bush. It has Gondwanan distribution, which means that it is mainly spread across the Southern Hemisphere, from Southern Africa, across to Australia. P. cynaroides belongs to the plant family Proteaceae. The genus Protea is placed under the tribe Proteae. Proteoideae is further divided into four tribes: Conospermeae, Petrophileae, ProteAE, and Leucadendreae. The specific epithet cynaroide refers to the artichoke-like appearance of the flower-heads. The name of the family and the genus derive from the Greek god Proteus, who was able to change between many forms. P. cynaroides is a woody shrub with thick stems and large dark green, glossy leaves. Most plants are one metre in height when mature, but may vary according to locality and habitat from 0.35 to 2 metres (1 ft 2 in to 6 ft 7 in) in height. Large, vigorous plants produce six to ten flower heads in one season, although some exceptional plants can produce up to forty flower heads on one plant. The soft pale pink bracts with a silvery sheen are the most prized. The genome of king protea has been sequenced and published in 2022, corresponding to the first genome sequenced in the Proteales order. Protea cynaroides grows in a harsh environment with dry, hot summers and wet, cold winters. Several adaptions include tough, leathery leaves, and a large taproot which penetrates deep into the soil to reach underground moisture. The flowers are fed at by a range of nectarivorous birds, mainly sunbirds and sugarbirds. In order to reach the nectar, the bird must push its bill into the inflorescence. As it does so, its bill and face gets brushed with pollen, thereby allowing for possible pollination. Along with birds, a host of insects are attracted to the flowerhead. P. cynaroides is adapted to an environment in which bushfires are essential for reproduction and regeneration. Most Protea species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank. resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. The king protea is the national flower of South Africa. It lends its name to the national cricket team, whose nickname is the Proteas. In the early 1990s, there was a political debate as to if and how the flower should be incorporated onto the national rugby team's shirts. It has several colour forms, and horticulturists have recognised 81 garden varieties, some of which have injudiciously been planted in its natural range. In some varieties the pink of the flower and red borders of leaves are replaced by a creamy yellow.
