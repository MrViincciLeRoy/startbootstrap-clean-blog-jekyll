<h2 class="section-heading">Care & Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthopsis Harv., commonly known as Chinese Abelia, is a deciduous shrub that thrives in moist, acidic, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. While it's noted for its tolerance to heat, humidity, deer, and rabbits, proper care is essential for optimal growth and flowering.

**Watering:** This shrub prefers consistent moisture, especially during its active growth period in spring and summer. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings to prevent root rot. However, it's drought-tolerant once established.

**Light:** It flourishes in full sun to partial shade. In regions with intense summer sun, partial shade can prevent leaf scorch.

**Soil:** Acanthopsis Harv. prefers acidic soils. Amend heavy clay soils with organic matter like peat moss or compost to improve drainage and acidity.

**Propagation:** The shrub is easily propagated by softwood cuttings in early summer or semi-hardwood cuttings in late summer. Root cuttings are also effective.

The plant's fragrant, white, and long-lasting flowers (blooming from early summer to fall) add to its appeal. While it's considered heat-tolerant, maintaining consistent moisture and providing adequate sunlight are key to cultivating a healthy and visually appealing Acanthopsis Harv. plant.
