<h2 class="section-heading">Care & Cultivation</h2>
<p>Caring for Afzelia involves understanding its native habitat and specific requirements for growth. This tree, known for its adaptability and resilience, can be successfully cultivated with attention to watering, light, soil, and propagation methods.</p>

<strong>Watering:</strong> Afzelia prefers well-drained soil and can tolerate drought conditions once established. While it's adaptable, regular watering during the first year is crucial to help it acclimate to its environment. Once mature, it's drought-resistant but benefits from occasional moisture, especially during dry spells.

<strong>Light:</strong> This species thrives in full sun to partial shade. For optimal growth and flowering, it should receive ample sunlight. In its native habitat, it grows in open woodlands and savannas, so a location that mimics these conditions will encourage healthy development.

<strong>Soil:</strong> Afzelia is quite adaptable to different soil types, but it prefers slightly acidic to neutral soils. It can tolerate sandy soils but benefits from well-drained conditions. Amending soil with organic matter can enhance fertility and water retention.

<strong>Propagation:</strong> Afzelia can be propagated through seeds or cuttings. Seed propagation is relatively simple and involves collecting ripe seeds in late autumn and sowing them in well-drained seed beds. Cuttings, taken from mature stems, can be rooted in a suitable growing medium, offering a quicker way to propagate this tree.

<p>In conclusion, Afzelia is a hardy and attractive tree suitable for various garden settings, provided it's given the right conditions of sunlight, appropriate watering, well-drained soil, and suitable propagation methods. Its native resilience makes it an excellent choice for parks and landscapes, offering both aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.</p>
