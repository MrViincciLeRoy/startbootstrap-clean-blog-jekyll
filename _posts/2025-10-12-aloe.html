<h2 class="section-heading">Care & Cultivation</h2>
<p>Aloe plants are succulents native to South Africa. They are easy to care for, and can be grown indoors as potted plants. Proper aloe plant care includes watering, light, soil, and propagation.</p>

<p>Watering: Aloe plants are succulents that store water in their thick leaves, so they don’t need frequent watering. In nature, they grow in desert climates where they hardly get any rain. Overwatering is the number one killer of aloe plants, so you should only water them when the soil is completely dry. You can water aloe plants with a spray bottle, or a watering can with a narrow spout. Water thoroughly until water drains out of the bottom of the pot. Allow the soil to dry out completely before watering again.</p>

<p>Light: Aloe plants need bright, indirect light to thrive. They can tolerate some direct sunlight, but too much can burn their leaves. Place your aloe plant near a window with filtered sunlight, or use a grow light if needed.</p>

<p>Soil: Aloe plants need well-draining soil to prevent root rot. You can use a cactus or succulent mix, or create your own by mixing potting soil with sand and perlite.</p>

<p>Propagation: Aloe plants can be easily propagated through leaf cuttings. Simply cut a leaf with a few leaves on it, and let it callus over for a few days. Then, plant the leaf cutting in well-draining soil, and water lightly. The cutting should root within a few weeks, and you can start to propagate more plants from this one.</p>
