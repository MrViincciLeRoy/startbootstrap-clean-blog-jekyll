<h2 class="section-heading">Care & Cultivation</h2>
<p>Acanthopsis harv. (1842) is a succulent shrub native to South Africa, specifically found in the Western Cape region. It's a member of the Asparagaceae family and is known for its striking architectural form and attractive foliage. Here's how to care for and cultivate this fascinating plant:

Watering:
- Acanthopsis harv. prefers well-drained soil and should be watered sparingly. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings.
- During the growing season (spring and summer), water when the top inch of soil is dry.
- In the dormant winter months, reduce watering significantly or allow the soil to dry out fully.

Light:
- This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers a location where it can receive at least 4-6 hours of direct sunlight each day.
- If planted outdoors, choose a spot that matches its light requirements.

Soil:
- Acanthopsis harv. grows best in well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter.
- A potting mix that mimics its natural habitat (rocky outcrops) would be ideal. This can be achieved by combining equal parts of potting soil, coarse sand, and perlite or pumice.

Propagation:
- The best method for propagating Acanthopsis harv. is through stem cuttings.
- Take cuttings in the spring when the plant is actively growing.
- Make clean cuts just below a leaf node and allow them to callus over before planting in well-draining soil.

Additional Notes:
- Acanthopsis harv. is relatively drought-tolerant once established, but regular watering during the first year will help it acclimate.
- It's important to keep the plant away from drafts and extreme temperature fluctuations.
- This succulent is generally pest and disease resistant, but watch out for mealybugs and scale insects if you notice them.
